                Hope Academy offers a comprehensive curriculum aligned with Connecticut State Standards. Instructional time is allotted specifically for<br/>
                language arts, math, science, and social studies as well as elective classes. While core academic instruction is delineated by subject,<br/>
                critical skills in reading comprehension, written expression, and executive functioning are reinforced across the curriculum. This<br/>
                allows for interdisciplinary connections within the learning process while also providing an increased opportunity for students to make<br/>
                meaningful academic gains.

                In addition to receiving instruction aligned with general education Standards, an Individualized Education Plan (IEP) is formulated for<br/>
                each student. Through the development and implementation of the IEP, each childâ€™s academic programming is personalized according<br/> 
                to his or her unique learning needs. When appropriate, classroom instruction is supplemented with enrichment experiences or targeted<br/> 
                intervention using scientific research-based methodologies to allow for an appropriate level of challenge and/ or support for all<br/> 
                students. Hope Academy maintains a low student-to-teacher ratio to ensure that all instruction is provided within a small group<br/>
                environment.
